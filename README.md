## About

This repository contains the three mains projects from CC3501 - Modeling and Computer Graphics for Engineers <br>
(5th semester of Computer Science Engineering at FCFM, University of Chile) from the fall semester of 2020 (2020-1). 

This course has a wide range of topics, such as:
- Algorithms and Techniques in Computer Graphics
- Modeling and Visualization (2D and 3D)
- Illumination on Polygon Meshes
- Finite Differences for EDPs
- Scientific Visualization

These 3 works cover the most important topics and are made with Python using Open GL.

## Quick Start and Requirements:

- [Download and install python 3.7 or higher ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install the necessary modules: `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pyopengl glfw ipython jupyter`
- Clone the repo: `https://github.com/salistito/Computer-Graphics.git`
- Enjoy :)

## Proyect 1b - Space Wars

A basic 2D game called Space Wars similar to Space Invaders using textures, basic shapes, keyboard comands and transformations using Open GL. To run the proyect is necessary to run the file space-war.py. This work was graded with a 86/100.

## Proyect 2c - Bird Migration Simulatior

## Proyect 3a - Aquarium Problem and Visualization (EDP's)

## Thanks

Thanks to Professor Daniel Calder√≥n for providing some code infrastructure that allowed us to create these projects!
