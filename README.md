About
-------

This repository contains the three mains projects from CC3501 - Modeling and Computer Graphics for Engineers <br>
(5th semester of Computer Science Engineering at FCFM, University of Chile) from the fall semester of 2020 (2020-1). 

This course has a wide range of topics, such as:
- Algorithms and Techniques in Computer Graphics
- Modeling and Visualization (2D and 3D)
- Illumination on Polygon Meshes
- Finite Differences for EDPs
- Scientific Visualization
- etc

These 3 works cover the most important topics and are made with Python using Open GL.
